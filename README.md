# Banking System
The Banking System is a Java-based application designed to facilitate banking operations such as account management, transactions, and user authentication. This project leverages JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) to interact with a MySQL database, ensuring seamless communication between the application and the database backend.
## Features
- **User Registration**: Allow users to register with their full name, email, and password.
- **User Authentication**: Securely authenticate users during login using their email and password.
- **Account Management**: Enable users to open new bank accounts and view their account balance.
- **Transaction Handling**: Support credit, debit, and fund transfer transactions between accounts.
- **Data Persistence**: Store user information, account details, and transaction records in a MySQL database.
## Technologies Used
- **Java**: Core programming language.
- **MySQL**: Relational database management system.
- **JDBC**: Java API for connecting Java applications to databases.
## Getting Started
To run the Banking System locally, ensure you have Java and MySQL installed on your system. Additionally, make sure to include the JDBC connector in your project's dependencies. You can download the JDBC connector from [MySQL's official website](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/j/) or use a build management tool like Maven or Gradle to include it automatically.

Once you have Java, MySQL, and the JDBC connector installed, clone the repository and follow the instructions in the project documentation to set up and run the system.
